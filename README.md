# Face-Recognition-Based-Smart-Lock-Using-OpenCV-Arduino
This project is a real-time smart lock system that uses face recognition for secure, contactless access. A webcam captures the userâ€™s face, detects it using a Haar Cascade Classifier, and recognizes it with OpenCVâ€™s LBPH algorithm.  If the face is authorized, a command is sent via serial communication to an Arduino,

# ðŸ”’ Face Recognition Smart Lock System

This project is a real-time **smart lock system** that uses **face recognition** for secure and hands-free access. It combines **OpenCV** for face detection and recognition with **Arduino** to control a **servo motor** acting as the door lock.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. A **webcam** captures the user's face.
2. **Haar Cascade Classifier** detects the face in real-time.
3. **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)** algorithm recognizes the user.
4. If the face is **authorized**, a signal is sent via **serial communication** to the **Arduino**.
5. The **Arduino** rotates a **servo motor** to unlock the door for 5 seconds.
6. If the face is **not recognized**, the door remains locked.
