# Face-Recognition-Based-Smart-Lock-Using-OpenCV-Arduino
This project is a real-time smart lock system that uses face recognition for secure, contactless access. A webcam captures the user’s face, detects it using a Haar Cascade Classifier, and recognizes it with OpenCV’s LBPH algorithm.  If the face is authorized, a command is sent via serial communication to an Arduino,
